A Template Hash Map implementation in C++ which is much faster and scalable than standard STL maps.
To compile and run just go to build dir and do ./build.sh which will create hashtest binary in bin folder. Just run this binary
To test performance of this  hash map compared to stl maps.
This is a generic hash map and can be fitted to any data types.
